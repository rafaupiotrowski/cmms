Installation of pip package in conda:
For others who run into this situation, I found this to be the most straightforward solution:

Run conda create -n venv_name and source activate venv_name, where venv_name is the name of your virtual environment.
Run conda install pip. This will install pip to your venv directory.
Find your anaconda directory, and find the actual venv folder. It should be somewhere like /anaconda/envs/venv_name/.
Install new packages by doing /anaconda/envs/venv_name/bin/pip install package_name.
This should now successfully install packages using that virtual environment's pip!
